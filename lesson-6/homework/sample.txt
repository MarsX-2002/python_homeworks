Vertical AI Agents
Vertical AI agents are highly specialized artificial intelligence (AI) systems designed for 
specific industries or use cases, tailored to address unique business processes and challenges. 
Unlike horizontal AI, which provides general-purpose tools, 
Vertical AI leverages industry-specific data and insights to deliver more relevant and actionable outcomes.
